-used to manage permissions (read, write, execute) for multiple users at once.

User and Group Relationships
A user can be in one primary group and multiple secondary groups.
Primary group is defined at user creation (or with usermod -g).
Secondary groups are assigned via usermod -aG or gpasswd.

-Primary group (one per user) - Default group - when user create new file
 (defined in /etc/passwd)	
	-every user must have one primary group
	-stored in /etc/passwd file as the user's GID (group ID)
-Secondary (or supplementary) group (zero or more per user)
 (defined in /etc/group)
	-secondary groups belongs to user, do not effect file creation but grant access to files or devices shared by those groups
	-A user can be part of many secondary groups - no limit

#Ps –u noman                    to see all processes by the user:
sudo kill -9 4472                Kill Specific Process (e.g. 4472)
sudo pkill -u noman        Kill All User Processes
sudo userdel noman       Delete the User
sudo userdel -r noman   With deleting home directory
sudo rm -rf /home/abc  forcefully and recursively remove everything under /home/abc.
getent passwd noman   verify user has deleted
 
sudo userdel abc              Deletes the user account, but leaves the home directory
sudo userdel -r abc          Deletes the user and their home directory.
sudo pkill -u abc                Kills all running processes of user abc, but doesn’t remove files.
Note: If just ran userdel without -r, their files remain in /home.
