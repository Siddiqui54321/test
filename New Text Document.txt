Assume:

user1 created: /home/user1/secret.txt

You want user2 to read secret.txt

1. Check current permissions (as root or user1):
ls -ld /home/user1
ls -l /home/user1/secret.txt


Default output likely:

drwx------  user1 user1 4096 ... /home/user1
-rw-------  user1 user1 ... secret.txt


This means only user1 can enter the directory and read the file.


-------------
2. Option A: Use a shared directory

Best practice: create a folder inside /home/user1 with limited access, like this:

# As user1
mkdir /home/user1/shared
chmod 755 /home/user1/shared
cp /home/user1/secret.txt /home/user1/shared/
chmod 644 /home/user1/shared/secret.txt


755 on shared allows others to enter the directory.

644 on secret.txt allows others to read the file.

Now, user2 can access:

cat /home/user1/shared/secret.txt

--------------
3. Option B: Give full access to home dir (not recommended)

If you must let user2 access all of /home/user1, change home dir permissions:

chmod 755 /home/user1
chmod 644 /home/user1/secret.txt


⚠️ Security Risk: This exposes all of user1’s files to read access by others. Avoid unless intentional.

✅ 4. Alternative: Use a group (advanced)

Create a group (e.g., sharedgroup)

Add both users to it

Set group ownership and permissions

Example:

# As root
groupadd sharedgroup
usermod -aG sharedgroup user1
usermod -aG sharedgroup user2

# As user1
mkdir /home/user1/shared
chgrp sharedgroup /home/user1/shared
chmod 770 /home/user1/shared

cp /home/user1/secret.txt /home/user1/shared/
chgrp sharedgroup /home/user1/shared/secret.txt
chmod 660 /home/user1/shared/secret.txt


Now only users in sharedgroup can access /home/user1/shared/secret.txt.

#rm -rf /home/abc  forcefully and recursively remove everything under /home/abc.
#getent passwd noman   verify user has deleted
#usermod -aG wheel noman       Add noman to the wheel group - This grants sudo access to the user.
$chmod 777 user1file.txt	add full permission
$chmod u-r user1file.txt	exclue user read permission
$chmod u+r user1file.txt	exclue user read permission

chown: to change user ownership
chgrp: to change group ownership


#Ps –u noman                    to see all processes by the user:
sudo kill -9 4472                Kill Specific Process (e.g. 4472)
sudo pkill -u noman        Kill All User Processes
sudo userdel noman       Delete the User
sudo userdel -r noman   With deleting home directory
sudo rm -rf /home/abc  forcefully and recursively remove everything under /home/abc.
getent passwd noman   verify user has deleted
 
sudo userdel abc              Deletes the user account, but leaves the home directory
sudo userdel -r abc          Deletes the user and their home directory.
sudo pkill -u abc                Kills all running processes of user abc, but doesn’t remove files.
Note: If just ran userdel without -r, their files remain in /home.
