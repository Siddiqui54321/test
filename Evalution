------------DELETING USER
The userdel command can’t delete a user if they are currently logged in or have processes running. You must first stop those processes.

#adduser noman
#userdel noman	Delete the User
#Ps –u noman  		to see all processes by the user:
sudo kill -9 4472	Kill Specific Process (e.g. 4472)
sudo pkill -u noman	Kill All User Processes
sudo userdel noman	Delete the User
sudo userdel -r noman	With deleting home directory 
sudo rm -rf /home/abc	forcefully and recursively remove everything under /home/abc.
getent passwd noman	verify user has deleted

sudo userdel abc	Deletes the user account, but leaves the home directory
sudo userdel -r abc	Deletes the user and their home directory.
sudo pkill -u abc	Kills all running processes of user abc, but doesn’t remove files.
Note: If just ran userdel without -r, their files remain in /home.
