--------------COPY FOLDER WITH DIRECTORIES AND FILES
sudo useradd user1            (userdel -r /home/user1)-remove with dir / (rm -rf /home/abc)-forcefully remove  
sudo passwd user1
sudo useradd user2
sudo passwd user2
su user1
mkdir mywork
cd mywork
mkdir 012025
mkdir 022025
cd 012025
touch abc.txt xyz.txt
su root
sudo cp -r /home/user1/. /home/user2
sudo mv /home/user1/* /home/user3 		(to move dir and files to other folder)

------------DELETING USER
The userdel command can’t delete a user if they are currently logged in or have processes running. You must first stop those processes.

#adduser noman
#userdel noman	Delete the User
#Ps –u noman  		to see all processes by the user:
sudo kill -9 4472	Kill Specific Process (e.g. 4472)
sudo pkill -u noman	Kill All User Processes
sudo userdel noman	Delete the User
sudo userdel -r noman	With deleting home directory 
sudo rm -rf /home/abc	forcefully and recursively remove everything under /home/abc.
getent passwd noman	verify user has deleted

sudo userdel abc	Deletes the user account, but leaves the home directory
sudo userdel -r abc	Deletes the user and their home directory.
sudo pkill -u abc	Kills all running processes of user abc, but doesn’t remove files.
Note: If just ran userdel without -r, their files remain in /home.

---------------------HOW DO YOU RECOVER ROOT PASSWORD

1. Start (Power on) the System. 
2. Wait for GRUB menu - press e to edit. 
3. Find the line starting with linux and type the rd.break at the end. 
4. Press Ctrl+x
5. mount –o remount,rw /sysroot
6. chroot /sysroot							(change root to sysroot)
7. touch /.autorelabel
8. exit
9. exit

-----------------Create user when logging the msg display: Authentication failure
getent passwd noman		(Make sure the user was created successfully)
sudo useradd -m noman	(If not, recreate the user)

sudo passwd noman 			          (Set the password)  or
echo "noman:abc" | sudo chpasswd	(Set the password)
sudo passwd -S noman			        (Check Account Status)
sudo passwd -u noman			        (If status is L (locked), unlock it)
udo journalctl –xe		          	(Check logs for exact error messages)


------------User Group
A user group is a collection of users in Linux that share the same permissions for accessing files, directories, or resources.
Why Groups Matter:
•	Makes permission management easier.
•	Lets you assign access to multiple users at once.
$groups		Check Groups for the Current User
$groups noman	Check Groups for a Specific User
$id noman		Detailed Group Info (Using id)
$cat /etc/group		List All Groups on the System
$getent group		List All Groups on the System

Solution: Add noman to the wheel Group
$su –				log in as root
#usermod -aG wheel noman	Add noman to the wheel group - This grants sudo access to the user.
#su – noman
$groups noman			Have noman Log Out and Back In and confirm wheel group access
$ whoami			it show ‘noman’
$sudo whoami			it show ‘root’		That confirms noman can now use sudo.
$sudo grep wheel /etc/sudoers	

sudo groupadd permitgroup		Create the New Group
sudo usermod –aG permitgroup noman	add user ‘noman’ to group
groups noman				Make sure permitgroup is listed.
getent group permitgroup		verify it created or not
sudo groupdel permitgroup		delete group
