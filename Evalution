--------------COPY FOLDER WITH DIRECTORIES AND FILES
sudo useradd user1            (userdel -r /home/user1)-remove with dir / (rm -rf /home/abc)-forcefully remove  
sudo passwd user1
sudo useradd user2
sudo passwd user2
su user1
mkdir mywork
cd mywork
mkdir 012025

cd 012025
touch abc.txt xyz.txt
su root
sudo cp -r /home/user1/. /home/user2
sudo mv /home/user1/* /home/user3 		(to move dir and files to other folder)

------------DELETING USER
The userdel command can’t delete a user if they are currently logged in or have processes running. You must first stop those processes.

#adduser noman
#userdel noman	Delete the User
#Ps –u noman  		to see all processes by the user:
sudo kill -9 4472	Kill Specific Process (e.g. 4472)
sudo pkill -u noman	Kill All User Processes
sudo userdel noman	Delete the User
sudo userdel -r noman	With deleting home directory 
sudo rm -rf /home/abc	forcefully and recursively remove everything under /home/abc.
getent passwd noman	verify user has deleted

sudo userdel abc	Deletes the user account, but leaves the home directory
sudo userdel -r abc	Deletes the user and their home directory.
sudo pkill -u abc	Kills all running processes of user abc, but doesn’t remove files.
Note: If just ran userdel without -r, their files remain in /home.

---------------------HOW DO YOU RECOVER ROOT PASSWORD

1. Start (Power on) the System. 
2. Wait for GRUB menu - press e to edit. 
3. Find the line starting with linux and type the rd.break at the end. 
4. Press Ctrl+x
5. mount –o remount,rw /sysroot
6. chroot /sysroot							(change root to sysroot)
7. touch /.autorelabel
8. exit
9. exit

-----------------Create user when logging the msg display: Authentication failure
getent passwd noman		(Make sure the user was created successfully)
sudo useradd -m noman	(If not, recreate the user)

sudo passwd noman 			          (Set the password)  or
echo "noman:abc" | sudo chpasswd	(Set the password)
sudo passwd -S noman			        (Check Account Status)
sudo passwd -u noman			        (If status is L (locked), unlock it)
sudo journalctl –xe		          	(Check logs for exact error messages)


------------User Group
A user group is a collection of users in Linux that share the same permissions for accessing files, directories, or resources.
Why Groups Matter:
•	Makes permission management easier.
•	Lets you assign access to multiple users at once.
$groups		Check Groups for the Current User
$groups noman	Check Groups for a Specific User
$id noman		Detailed Group Info (Using id)
$cat /etc/group		List All Groups on the System
$getent group		List All Groups on the System

Solution: Add noman to the wheel Group
$su –				log in as root
#usermod -aG wheel noman	Add noman to the wheel group - This grants sudo access to the user.
#su – noman
$groups noman			Have noman Log Out and Back In and confirm wheel group access
$ whoami			it show ‘noman’
$sudo whoami			it show ‘root’		That confirms noman can now use sudo.
$sudo grep wheel /etc/sudoers	

sudo groupadd permitgroup		Create the New Group
sudo usermod –aG permitgroup noman	add user ‘noman’ to group
groups noman				Make sure permitgroup is listed.
getent group permitgroup		verify it created or not
sudo groupdel permitgroup		delete group

-----------To close user ‘noman’ (it will not display through #w command)
#pkill -u noman
#exit
$w		
$whoami
$lastlog
#lastb		(bad logins)
#last		(List of Users Logged-in and Logged out / shutdown)

------------There are 5 Type of Users in Linux: 
1. System User (This is Root User and the Admin) 
2. Normal User (This is a user created by Root User) 
3. Network User (this is a remote user that is logs-in Windows Active Directory or LDAP in the case of Linux Users} 
4. System User based on an installed application like Oracle etc. 
5. Sudo User (normal users who have admin or root privileges.

#w		(show currently logged in user)	
#who		(show currently logged in user with detail i.e. user   tty   login date/time)
#whoami	(show currently logged in user, only user name)
# cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd	(all users that exist, only name)
#getent passwd		(all users that exist, with detail)

Note: 	the best way to switch user ‘Ctrl+Alt+F2’
	#su -	(root)
	#su – noman	(other user)

----------------------Prob: I login to root user then I logged in as 'su - noman' . when execute 'w' then only root user show.
Even though you're now running commands as noman (via su - noman), you're still using the same terminal session that belongs to root.
•	The w command shows users logged in through a TTY or PTY (e.g., SSH sessions, console logins, terminal windows).
•	su - noman switches the user identity within the same session — it doesn't create a new login session.
So w continues to show root, because the controlling terminal still belongs to root.
Even though you're now running commands as noman (via su - noman), you're still using the same terminal session that belongs to root.
•	The w command shows users logged in through a TTY or PTY (e.g., SSH sessions, console logins, terminal windows).
•	su - noman switches the user identity within the same session — it doesn't create a new login session.
So w continues to show root, because the controlling terminal still belongs to root.
Solution:
How to Actually Log In as noman (and see in w)
To see noman listed as a logged-in user in w, you need to log in as noman from a new terminal or SSH session, not via su.
✔ Option 1: Switch TTY
1.	Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 (or F3, F4...) to switch to another virtual terminal.
2.	Log in as noman directly.

--------Static IP address	that does not change over time. It is manually assigned to a device (like a server, PC, router, or printer) and remains constant
--------dynamic IP address	which is automatically assigned by a DHCP server and can change over time.

When to use sudo:
•	sudo is needed when you run commands that require administrative (root) privileges.
Installing software (dnf install), modifying system files, starting/stopping system services, changing firewall settings — these all usually need sudo.
•	Regular users (non-root) cannot perform these actions without sudo.
________________________________________
Do all users use sudo?
•	Only users who have been granted permission to use sudo (usually members of the wheel or sudo group) can run commands with sudo.
•	If a user is not in those groups, trying sudo will either:
o	Ask for a password and then deny access, or
o	Simply deny access outright.

Commands to Set Up Apache on Rocky Linux
Once you're logged in to your EC2 instance using PuTTY:
sudo dnf update -y	Update the system	
sudo dnf install httpd -y	Install Apache (httpd)	
sudo systemctl start httpd	Start Apache	
sudo systemctl enable httpd	Enable Apache to start on boot	
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd –reload	Allow HTTP through the firewall (if firewalld is running)
Note: This step may not be needed if your AWS Security Group already allows port 80 (HTTP). But it’s safe to run anyway.
